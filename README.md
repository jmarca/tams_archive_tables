# Poke archive tables for contents

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/jmarca/tams_archive_tables.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/jmarca/tams_archive_tables)

This package will query the contents of the archive.signaturearchive_*
tables in order first to find out which are there, and second to find
out what each one holds.
